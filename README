SBinary is a library for describing binary protocols, in the form of mappings between Scala types and binary formats. It can be used as a robust serialization mechanism for Scala objects or a way of dealing with existing binary formats found in the wild.

It started out life as a loose port of Haskell's Data.Binary. It's since evolved a bit from there to take advantage of the features Scala implicits offer over Haskell type classes, but the core idea has remained the same.
